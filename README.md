# Zero to Full-Stack Via Weekly Widgets
This mini-project is all about helping someone go from zero to full stack by writing simple MVP products as a way to get familiar with Deployment. 

The technologies in the project (roughly in the order they are introduced) are:
- Figma
- HTML/CSS
- Git
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Heroku
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Vanilla JS
- JQuery
- React
- Redux
- Digital Ocean
- SSH
- WordPress
- Jenkins (Build Tool)
- Octopus (CI/CD Tool)
- AWS
- Namecheap DNS config

*Note: Note every project will use all the technologies listed above. The projects **are** organized in an order of 'least difficult' to 'most most difficult' so you can safely assume later projects will use more complex technologies/frameworks and deployments.*

## Project 0 My-Site
Description: 

A site that will be your portfolio! As we build projects, we'll update this site so that it points at those projects! It may not look like much at first, but as time goes on you'll be able to watch it grow!

We'll start by making a simple html page. We'll learn about tags, and how they can create the skeleton of our site. We'll also use Git and Github to maintain versions of our product. 

Technology Loadout:
